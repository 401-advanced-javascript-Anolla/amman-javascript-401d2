# Code Challenges

## Work in a proper `data-structures-and-algorightms` repository

> Template: <https://github.com/codefellows/data-structures-and-algorithms>

Each Day, you will will have a new code challenge, based on a particular "Data Structure" which is designed to test your understanding of that data structure.

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

Your work should be completed within the `challenges` folder nested beneath a folder named for the data structure itself.

File naming rules and folder structures are given to you in every challenge.

Your repository must be connected to GitHub Actions, running tests on every push

## A complete code challenge assignment includes:

- Proper file, folder names, according to the assignment
- Tests, visibly running/passing through GitHub Actions
- A unique branch name for each code challenge (i.e. `challenge-01`)
- A pull request for that branch, formatted with the checklist template
- A README.md file that describes your work, conforming to the requirements

## Grading Notes

Your grade is based on:

- Code Quality
  - Your grader will be reviewing your Pull Request and leaving notes inline
- Test Coverage
  - Your tests must assert completion and operation of the feature tasks
  - Your tests must cover a high percentage of your code
- README
  - A Well Written README, which includes all sections in the template
  - An image of your whiteboard

## Canvas Submission

- Submit a link to the README.md from your assignment branch in Canvas
